Our idea comes from the heart. Both of our families were raised in West Africa so it is only right that we try to create a software that will improve the communication and knowledge of doctors and nurses in that region of Africa
We will be exploring codes that will help develop the best detailed site for our nonprofit. We will also explore other nonprofit sites to examine their sites and see what we would do differently in order to get our message across. From their we can attract donors who will help us to build the organization.
